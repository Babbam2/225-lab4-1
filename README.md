# Lab 4-1

This is an extension of the simple flask/sqlite3 app but with persistence.  Deploys to your LoadBalanced IP on port 80.  Please note: This requires persistence to be set up on your cluster!  Please do not attempt until it has been added!

You will need to modify:
1) Your dockerfile.
2) Your Jenkinsfile.
3) Your deployment-dev.yaml.
